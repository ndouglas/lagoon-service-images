# amazee.io lagoon Makefile The main purpose of this Makefile is to provide easier handling of
# building images and running tests It understands the relation of the different images (like
# centos7-node6 is based on centos7) and builds them in the correct order Also it knows which
# services in docker-compose.yml are depending on which base images or maybe even other service
# images
#
# The main commands are:

# make pull
# Tries to pull already existing Docker images from dockerhub in order to use them as layer caching
# for a build. Define with `TAG` which branch of images you would like to pull, by default this is
# `master`. Example: `make pull TAG=develop`

# make build/<imagename>
# Builds an individual image and all of it's needed parents. Run `make build-list` to get a list of
# all buildable images. Make will keep track of each build image with creating an empty file with
# the name of the image in the folder `build`. If you want to force a rebuild of the image, either
# remove that file or run `make clean`

# make build
# builds all images in the correct order. Uses existing images for layer caching, define via `TAG`
# which branch should be used

# make tag-push
# Tags all previously build images with a given `TAG` and pushes them to the `amazeeiolagoon`
# registry which will then can be used again for `make pull` to save build Images between CI runs

# make tests/<testname>
# Runs individual tests. In a nutshell it does:
# 1. Builds all needed images for the test
# 2. Starts needed Lagoon services for the test via docker-compose up
# 3. Executes the test
#
# Run `make tests-list` to see a list of all tests.

# make tests
# Runs all tests together. Can be executed with `-j2` for two parallel running tests

# make up
# Starts all Lagoon Services at once, usefull for local development or just to start all of them.

# make logs
# Shows logs of Lagoon Services (aka docker-compose logs -f)

# make openshift
# Some tests need a full openshift running in order to test deployments and such. This can be
# started via openshift`. It will:
# 1. Download the `oc` cli
# 2. Create a loopback device on the current machine in order to have preditable IP addresses of
#    the OpenShift Console and Registry
# 3. Start an OpenShift Cluster

# make openshift/stop
# Removes an OpenShift Cluster

# make openshift/clean
# Removes all openshift related things: OpenShift itself and the oc cli

# make publish-images
# Pushes images that will be used by amazee.io clients during local development to the amazeeio
# dockerhub registry
